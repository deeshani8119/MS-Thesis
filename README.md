# MS-Thesis
In this dissertation we intend to study the background related to the mem- ory effect that leads to "gravitational-wave memory effect" and two types of memory effect:(1) We intend to study a whole outline of what is mem- ory effect.(2) We intend to solve the linear memory for N Gravitationally Unbound Particles where we will study different kinds of spherical harmon- ics,mass quadrapole leading to linear memory effect.(3)Then we try to exam- ine the memory effect for the individual radiated neutrinos[9] (4) Then we will discuss briefly about the introduction of non linear memory effect.
